        <p>Dear Bestie,</p>
        <p>
            <u><i>For You, On Your 19th Birthday</i></u><br>
            Nineteen candles, each one bright,<br>
            For a friend who’s always been my light.<br>
            Though words aren’t spoken every day,<br>
            In every silence, you find a way.<br>
            We don’t need to talk for hours long,<br>
            To know our friendship’s always strong.<br>
            You lift me up when I feel low,<br>
            Your quiet love helps me to grow.<br>
            We’ve guided each other, through wrong and right,<br>
            And in dark times, you’ve been my light.<br>
            A smile, a word, a gentle hand,<br>
            You understand when no one can.<br>
            Nineteen years, and here you stand,<br>
            A shining soul, with a heart so grand.<br>
            Though we don’t always speak aloud,<br>
            You’ve made me grateful, you’ve made me proud.<br>
            So today I wish you joy and more,<br>
            May life’s blessings come ashore.<br>
            For you, my friend, are truly rare,<br>
            I’ll always be here, I’ll always care.<br>
            So here’s to you, my kindred friend, my sister through the years,<br>
            Let’s raise a glass to memories, to laughter, and to tears.<br>
            Though paths may twist and wander, one truth remains the same:<br>
            Our friendship shines eternal, like an everlasting flame.<br><br>
